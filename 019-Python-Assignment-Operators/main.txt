=
Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
c = a + b assigns value of a + b into c

+= Add AND
It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand
c += a is equivalent to c = c + a

-= Subtract AND
It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand
c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a

*= Multiply AND
It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand
c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a

/= Divide AND
It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand
c /= a is equivalent to c = c / ac /= a is equivalent to c = c / a

%= Modulus AND
It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand
c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a

**= Exponent AND
Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand
c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a

//= Floor Division
It performs floor division on operators and assign value to the left operand
c //= a is equivalent to c = c // a
